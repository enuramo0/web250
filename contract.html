        <h2>Course Contract</h2>
        <p>I, <a href="http://students.cpcc.edu/~enuramo0/web250/introduction.html">Endale G. Nuramo</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring WEB250-N890 Adv. Markup & Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.
        </p>
